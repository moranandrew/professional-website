            <p>
                This project created a program that allows the user to write music notation through a series of
                predefined simple gestures. It
                uses a bidding system based on the type of gesture and location of the gesture on the screen to discern
                what notation the user intended. This project represents approximately 70 to 80 hours of time spent
                programming over a semester.

                Developed as a small team, this project was to create a mobile application that was devoloped to address
                the issue of living in a shared living situation and being able to keep track of everyones personal
                belongings. What resulted was an application that enabled individauls to create an inventory of thier
                personal items and then when in a household with other individuals also in the app they could mark items
                as in shared spaces so that everyone would be aware of them.
