            <p>
                This project created a program that allows the user to write music notation through a series of
                predefined simple gestures. It
                uses a bidding system based on the type of gesture and location of the gesture on the screen to discern
                what notation the user intended. This project represents approximately 70 to 80 hours of time spent
                programming over a semester.

                as in shared spaces so that everyone would be aware of them.
